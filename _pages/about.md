I'm Tianqi Zhang, an underguaduate student from Tsinghua University, majoring in Mathematics and Physics & Measurement Control Technology and Instruments. 
During my studies at Tsinghua University, I have interned in [iDLAB]{http://www.idlab-tsinghua.com/thulab/labweb/index.html} led by [Shengbo Li]{https://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/80/1812.html}.
I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to go to UC Berkeley for summer research at the end of my junior year, where I was advised by [Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/masayoshi-tomizuka/) and worked closely with [Mingyu Ding](https://dingmyu.github.io/) and [Wei Zhan](https://zhanwei.site/).

I am interested in robot learning and computer vision.
+ Robot learning: Using a robotic arm as the platform, I aim to make robots more practical by developing more robust and secure algorithms.
+ Computer vision: I hope to develop a foundation model for 3D segmentation that can generalize across various domains and applications, enabling efficient and accurate segmentation of 3D objects in complex environments.
